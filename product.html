  This organization started with the desire to inform people about the numurous amount of strays found around every neighborhood, especially mine, with an online website. It was creating in hopes of reducing the numbers of the stray animals by finding them forever homes, teaching people that is better to adopt then shop.

  <u><h3>The Social Problem:</h3></u>
  Everyday, more people choose to get rid of their pets whether it be because it's too expensive to take care of them, or they don't time for them or sadly they get tired of them and instead of putting them up for adoption, or taking them to a no kill shelter, they decide to leave them out on the streets. This causes the problem of so many strays in desperate need of a home as well as love and attention.
  Stray animals not only can cause car accidents, but the also can cause messes looking for food un garbage cans as well as sleepless nights because of other animales barking or hissing at the strays all night long. This is why I feel this website is a good way to inform others so we can reduce the numbers of the poor defenseless animals of the streets.

<u><h3>Reasons Why you should adopt strays:</h3></u>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You save a life.
    </li>
    <li>
      You break the cycle of pet overpopulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      You help stop cruelty in mass breeding facilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      You take advantage of adopting an adult animal.
    </li>
    <li>
      You pay less.
    </li>
    <li>
      Street animals are immensly loyal to those who give them homes and care.
    </li>
    <li>
      Strays display exceptional intelligence owing to the struggles they have to face daily.
    </li>
    <li>
      They have robust immunity. Most strays are often mixed within breeds. This makes them less vulnerable to inherited diseases which are more likely in pure-breds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each year, approximately 2.7 million dogs and cats are killed every year because shelters are too full and there aren’t enough adoptive homes. 
    <li>
      You are indirectly shutting down those horrible puppy mills. By adopting stray dogs, you can set an example to others for stopping this inhumane industry that gives only misery for the dogs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Be someone who encourages adopting a stray. Encourage others to save lives! You will get your good karma for giving an animal the love they deserve.

  <u><h3>Proper precautions:</h3></u>
  <h4>First of, DON'T cause an accident.</h4>
  -You can't help an animal if you become injured in the process. Look in your rear-view mirror before braking, turn on your signal, pull your car completely off the road, turn off the ignition, set the parking brake, and put on the hazard lights. If you have emergency flares, prepare to use them.
  <h4>Safety first</h4>
  -A strange, frightened, and possibly sick or injured animal can behave unpredictably. A sudden move on your part, even opening your car door, can spook them and cause them to bolt—possibly right onto the highway. If the animal looks or acts threatening, or if you feel uneasy about the situation, stay in your car.
  -If possible, restrain the animal. Create a barrier or use a carrier, leash, piece of cloth, or length of rope to keep the animal in the area. Signal approaching vehicles to slow down if you cannot confine the animal, or divert traffic around them if they appear to be injured and is still on the roadway.
  <h4>Use caution</h4>
  -Use caution when approaching the animal. Should you succeed in getting close enough to capture them, you stand a good chance of being scratched or bitten.
  -When moving toward the animal, speak calmly to reassure them. Make sure they can see you at all times as you approach, and perhaps entice them to come to you by offering strong-smelling food such as canned tuna or dried liver.

<h4>Lure them into your car</h4>
  -If you are certain you can get help from animal control very soon, try to lure the animal into your car with food, close the door and wait for help. In most cases it isn't a good idea to attempt to drive somewhere with a strange dog unrestrained in your car; they may become frantic or aggressive. Cats may do the same, as well as lodge themselves under the car seat, and it can be dangerous trying to extract them.
  <h4>Call for backup</h4>
  -If you're not able to safely restrain the animal, call the local animal control agency (in rural areas, call the police). Do so whether or not the animal is injured, and whether or not they are wearing an identification tag. Leave your phone number with the dispatcher, and try to get an estimate of how long it may take someone to respond. If possible, stay on the scene to keep an eye on the dog or cat until help arrives. Make sure you report to authorities precisely where the animal is by using road names, mile markers or landmarks.
  <h4>Transport to safety</h4>
  -If you are able to transport the animal, take them to the nearest animal shelter. If you plan to keep the animal in the event no owner is found, notify animal control that you have the animal or that you have taken them to a veterinary hospital for treatment. You can usually place a free "found" ad in your local newspaper or on sites like Craigslist. Keep any identification, such as collar or tags.

<h4>If you decide to take the animal home</h4>
  -If you decide to try to find the owner yourself, be sure to contact your local animal shelter or animal control office first. This will give you an opportunity to let the appropriate agency know that you have the animal and to provide a description to them, in case the owner contacts them. Also, have the animal scanned for a microchip; this quick ID check could help you find the owner right away.
  -Before bringing the animal home, make sure you can keep your resident animals separate; the found animal could be sick, fearful or aggressive with other animals. Once you have them safely at your home, take pictures and create a “found pet” flier to post around the area in which the animal was found. You can also post notices at veterinary hospitals and on websites such as petfinder.com.
  If you’ve tried to find the owner without success, but are unable to keep the animal long-term, you can try to re-home the animal yourself.

<div class="consider">
<center><u><h3>Things to consider</u></h3></center>
  <ul>
  <li>-If you're uncertain about whether or not to help or keep an animal you see alongside the road, here's a final word of advice: First, think of what you would want the finder of your animal to do if they happened to find them injured without their collar.</li>
<br> 
  <li>-You'd want them to take your pet to a veterinarian, and you'd want them to try to find you. At the same time, be reasonable about how much you can afford to do for that animal if no owner shows up.</li>
<br>    
  <li>-Good Samaritans who have never lost a cherished companion animal may conclude that the owner of the found dog or cat callously abandoned them or, at the very least, neglected to keep them safely confined at home. But accidents can happen to anyone. The frantic owner could be looking everywhere for their beloved pet.</li>
<br>    
  <li>-Finally, be honest with yourself in answering these questions: Are you willing to add them to your household? And will you be willing to return them to their original home if the owner turns up after you've started to form an attachment? If you answer “no” to these questions, your best option may be to take the animal directly to the shelter or contact animal control for assistance.</li>
