    <p><center><h3>Hi!</h3>
      <br>
I’m the creator of “Bring New Life To Strays”, Angie. I’m 17 at the time that this website was created. I’m from Puerto Rico and currently in my senior year of high school. I’m also a student of <a href="https://www.sowcoders.org/">SOWCoders</a>. My passion is art, anime, and animals (Triple A).

Ever since I can remember, I’ve always had pets. From cats to dogs, fish, chickens, birds. Some of my pets have been rescued. My family and I always try to help out an animal in need. From finding the owners of lost pets to taking in strays and giving them homes. My cat Binx, was a kitten whom I found in the motor of a car in my school. My family and I even helped a turtle that found its way to my front door, and we brought it back to the river. So, saving animals and protecting them has always been important to me.

I find it heartbreaking to see so many animals suffering and being mistreated. I know how important animals are to humans mental and emotional health, so why not help both animals and humans find each other. Helping animals find their forever homes not only helps the animals be off of the streets but also, helps people who are looking for companionship and something to love and call their own. Unfortunately, animals that are sent to shelters are sacrificed if not adopted in a certain time frame. This is why it is important to adopt and not shop. Give these animals an opportunity to have a happy and healthy life filled with love and care. So search my website and start making happy memories!</p></center>
